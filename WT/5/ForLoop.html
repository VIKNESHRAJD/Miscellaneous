<script type="text/javascript">
for (i=0; i<=5; i++)
{
document.write("<b>The number is " + i + "</b>")
document.write("<br>")
}
</script>
<p>Explanation:
<p>The for loop sets <b>i</b> equal to 0
<p>As long as <b>i</b> is less than or equal to 5, the loop will continue to run.
<p><b>i</b> will increase by 1 each time the loop runs.
